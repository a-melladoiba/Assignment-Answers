This is the second Assignment for the Bioinformatics Computational Challenges in the Master's of Computrational Biology

For running the program, the main.rb script should be called.
The reccommended code to run the program from the Terminal is : ruby main.rb ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt Report.txt

For the program to work, ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt file should be at the same directory where are the scripts.

CONCLUSSION:
Throughout the report it can be seen that, out of 168 genes, most of them do not show a network behaviour, being the lesser of them the ones that form networks.
That being said, it can be concluded that, out of those nearly 200 genes, few of them have annotated interactions among them.

CREDITS:
Some credits are added throughout the scripts.
Most of the work was done thanks to the help of Bing Chat GPT-4 and the research through several Stackoverflow threads.
