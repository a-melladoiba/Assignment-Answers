This is the first Assignment for the Bioinformatics Computational Challenges in the Master's of Computrational Biology

For running the program, the main.rb script should be called. It rules the other scipts, like the One Ring.

For the program to work, StockDatabaseDataFiles.zip files should be decompressed at the same directory where are the scripts.

The suggested code is the following:
ruby main.rb gene_information.tsv seed_stock_data.tsv cross_data.tsv new_stock_file.tsv 


CREDITS:
Some credits are added throughout the scripts.
Most of the changes were done thanks to the use of Bing Chat GPT-4 and the research through several Stackoverflow threads.
